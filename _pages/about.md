Hello y'all! This is Saundarya Keshari, currently a pre-final yearite in the **Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering** at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/). I am mostly interested in Algorithms, and more recently in Digital Design.

Coming to Algorithms, I love [Competitive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), and am always eager to learn new techniques and algorithms. My favourite topics are Dynamic Programming and Graphs!

Coming to programming languages, I am most fascinated and interested in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)! Apart from this, I know a thing or two about, [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/java)!

Please feel free to check out my [resume](../files/full_cv.pdf) and drop me an email at `sk.jazzsterq@gmail.com` if you want to chat with me!
